# ToAIorNot
This is a working-progress project, where I use a fastai model to detect if an image is AI generated or not. This project was inspired by the courses and lectures made by fastai themselves. I'm doing this project for curiosity and practice, I'm still learning about deep learning so the model used will need to be finetuned by me.
